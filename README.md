# Shadowdale Mudlet Scripts

This is a collection of scripts, aliases and triggers I wrote to be used with
[Mudlet][Mudlet homepage] in the [Shadowdale MUD][GNSMud forum].

I have decided not to store them in the XML used by Mudlet for importing/
exporting so as to make them more manageable and editable: instead each file
contains the Lua code which is the main body of the script/alias/trigger
and a small header containing a description of the code, some instructions
and all the other parameters needed (like patterns for execution/detection).

Have fun!
